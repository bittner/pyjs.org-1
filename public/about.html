<h2>What is Pyjamas?</h2>
<p>
<b><span class="m">Pyjamas</span> is a Rich Internet Application (RIA)
Development Platform for both Web and Desktop.</b>
</p>
<p>
It contains a Python-to-Javascript compiler, an AJAX framework
and a Widget Set API. Pyjamas started life as a Python port
of
<a href="http://code.google.com/webtoolkit/">Google Web Toolkit</a>,
the Java-to-Javascript compiler. Read
the <a href="./FAQ.html">FAQ</a> and the <a
href="./features.html">list of features</a>.</p>

<h2>What is Pyjamas Desktop?</h2>

<p>
<b><span class="m">Pyjamas Desktop</span> is the Desktop version of Pyjamas</b>
</p>
<p>Pyjamas Desktop allows the exact same python application source code to be
executed as a Desktop application.  Since Pyjamas 0.6 Pyjamas Desktop has been
integrated into the Pyjamas Release.  Pyjamas Desktop is conceptually
equivalent to Adobe AIR.
</p>

<h2>Why should I use Pyjamas?</h2>

<p>You can write web applications in python - a readable programming
language - instead of in HTML and Javascript, both of which become
quickly unreadable for even medium-sized applications. Your
application's design can benefit from encapsulating high level
concepts into classes and modules (instead of trying to fit as much
HTML as you can stand into one page); you can reuse - and import -
classes and modules.</p>

<p>Also, the AJAX library takes care of all the browser
interoperability issues on your behalf, leaving you free to focus
on application development instead of learning all the "usual"
browser incompatibilities.
</p>

<h2>I don't get it</h2>

<p>
Fear not - you are not alone: the true purpose and nature of Pyjamas
is blissfully opaque to many.  Will and Abe come to the rescue, with
their <a href="./will_and_abe_guide_to_pyjamas.html">Guide to Pyjamas</a>.
On mature reflection, however, it's probably best to read the
<a href="./FAQ.html">FAQ</a> and then contact the people on the
<a href="http://groups.google.com/group/pyjamas-dev">Mailing List</a>.
