<h2><span class="m">Pyjamas</span> is an Application Development
Platform for Web and Desktop.</h2>
<p>It contains a Python-to-Javascript compiler, an AJAX framework
and a Widget Set API. Pyjamas started life as a Python port
of
<a href="http://code.google.com/webtoolkit/">Google Web Toolkit</a>,
the Java-to-Javascript compiler. Read
the <a href="./FAQ.html">FAQ</a> and the <a
href="./features.html">list of features</a>.</p>

<h2><span class="m">Pyjamas Desktop</span> is the Desktop version
of Pyjamas</h2>
<p>Pyjamas Desktop allows the exact same python application source code to be
executed as a Desktop application.  Since Pyjamas 0.6 Pyjamas Desktop has been
integrated into the Pyjamas Release.  Pyjamas Desktop is conceptually
equivalent to Adobe AIR.

<h2>Why should I use it?</h2>
<p>You can write web applications in python - a readable programming
language - instead of in HTML and Javascript, both of which become
quickly unreadable for even medium-sized applications. Your
application's design can benefit from encapsulating high level
concepts into classes and modules (instead of trying to fit as much
HTML as you can stand into one page); you can reuse - and import -
classes and modules.</p>

<p>Also, the AJAX library takes care of all the browser
interoperability issues on your behalf, leaving you free to focus
on application development instead of learning all the "usual"
browser incompatibilities.</p>
