<h2>Getting Started</h2>

<p>Pyjamas is slightly different from traditional Web development:
it's more like Desktop application development. Emphasising this
and helping you to begin developing your first application,
is a
<a href="./getting_started.html">getting started</a>
page. Also, a more comprehensive and
direct guide to getting started is in the online
<a href="./book/output/Bookreader.html#Getting%20Started">Pyjamas
Book</a>.</p>

<h2>Building User Interfaces with Pyjamas</h2>

<p>The <code>ui</code> module contains all of the main classes you
need to create your user interface. At first, this module can be a
quite confusing because of the number of classes defined. To become
familiar with the user interface side of Pyjamas, you might like to
refer to the
<a href="./showcase/Showcase.html">Pyjamas User Interface Showcase</a>.
You might find the
<a href="./uiHierarchy.html">ui module class hierarchy</a>
useful.</p>

<p>Additionally, there is
<a href="./api">API documentation</a>, along with a
<a href="./controls_tutorial.html">tutorial</a>
on how to create your own interactive widget. </p>
