<h2>Features</h2>
<ul>

  <li style="padding-bottom: 8px;" />

    Dynamic and reusable UI components: programmers can use
    pre-designed classes to implement otherwise time-consuming
    dynamic behaviors, such as drag-and-drop or sophisticated visual
    tree structures.

  <li style="padding-bottom: 8px;" />

    Supports basic python types, emulated in javascript, such as List,
    Dictionary, Tuple, string; many of the standard python builtin
    functions, such as map, filter, range; and some of the standard
    python Exceptions are supported.

  <li style="padding-bottom: 8px;" />

    Declarative style of "desktop" widget programming (almost identical to
    python-qt4, python-gtk2 and python-wxWidgets), yet the applications
    are compiled to javascript and run in all major web browsers.

  <li style="padding-bottom: 8px;" />

    Simple RPC mechanism

  <li style="padding-bottom: 8px;" />

    Browser history management, covering "Back", "Forward" with no hassle
    for the developer.  AJAX applications typically break the "Go Back"
    button: use the History module to provide your application with
    History management.

  <li style="padding-bottom: 8px;" />

    Run-time Support for runtime errors: a function call stack can be kept
    in debug mode, and displayed when a runtime error occurs.  This is
    incredibly useful in situations where installing a Javascript debugger
    is inconvenient or impossible.

  <li style="padding-bottom: 8px;" />

    Pyjamas handles all cross-browser issues for the developer.

  <li style="padding-bottom: 8px;" />

    The developers can mix handwritten JavaScript in the Python source code,
    including plumbing in to other Javascript frameworks and libraries.

  <li style="padding-bottom: 8px;" />

    Beginnings of support for using Google APIs in GWT applications
    (initially, support for Google Gears Database)

  <li style="padding-bottom: 8px;" />

    Pyjamas is entirely Free Software.

  <li style="padding-bottom: 8px;" />

    The developers can design and develop their application in
    a pure object-oriented fashion, since they're using Python
    (instead of JavaScript).
