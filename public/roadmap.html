<h2>Pyjamas Roadmap</h2>
<p>
As Pyjamas comprises several projects, each has its own future and direction.
</p>
<h3>Pyjamas Compiler</h2>
<p>
<ul>
<li /> Add support for exec and eval (like Skulpt).
<li /> Improve the python interoperability support for --strict, with the
       goal of providing full and complete python interoperability for this
       mode.
<li /> Provide a complete suite of interoperable python modules.
<li /> Be able to run and pass the standard http://python.org test suite,
       under pyv8run and pysmrun (all 25,000 regression tests).
<li /> Add decorators to all functions which allow the declaration of the types
       of parameters and the return result, and enhance the compiler so that
       it optimises the generated code.  One of the flaws of the python
       programming language is that every operation (+, -, len etc.) requires
       double-checking the type of the object, and http://python.org
       always check whether the two types are integers, then moves into
       complex detection and type coercion second.  Converting this logic
       to javascript has proved to be very expensive for --strict.
       Emacs and PyQT4 solve this by allowing the type of
       parameters and the return result to be declared in advance.
<li /> Complete the enhancements work listed in the TODO file.
</ul>
</p>

<h3>Pyjamas Widget Set</h2>
<p>
<ul>
<li /> Continue to track GWT Widgets
<li /> Seek out cool and useful projects to convert to Pyjamas, such as
       gwt-g3d (WebGL 3D API using new HTML5 features)
<li /> Make automated conversion of GWT-compliant code into Pyjamas code
       much easier.
</ul>
</p>

<h3>Pyjamas Desktop</h2>
<p>
<ul>
<li /> Add more runtimes, especially for MacOSX and embedded systems.
<li /> Provide easy-to-install dependencies for all platforms across all
       computing architectures
       (webkitgtk is <b>not</b> easy to install on Win32 or MacOSX,
       neither is pywebkitgtk).
<li /> Change the startup API so that it uses the HTML loader file to
       detect the module (just like pyjs)
<li /> Provide the means to open several web engine windows (support for
       Window.open) and still have them load and run pyjamas applications.
</ul>
</p>
