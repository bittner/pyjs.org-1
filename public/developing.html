<h2>How to set up a development environment</h2>

<p>Web application development can be tricky: it can come as a
bit of a shock when compared to python app development to learn
that web browsers do not come with <em>any</em> proper debugging
assistance whatsoever, by default. You <strong>will</strong> need
to install and/or enable a debugger in the browsers that you use:</p>

<ul>
<li> For Firefox, install both Venkman and Firebug.</li>
<li> For IE, install the "Microsoft Script Debugger".</li>
<li> For Safari, go to the settings and enable "Development".</li>
<li> Opera users, you are extremely lucky: opera has stack tracing by default.</li>
</ul>

<p>You should also note that the Pyjamas compiler has a "-d" option
which will enable a python-like stack trace when a javascript
exception occurs. The amount of javascript generated can be FIVE
times larger, so only enable this during development.</p>

<p>Lastly, it is worth reiterating that Pyjamas-Desktop runs as
pure python: you should give serious consideration to running the
application under Pyjamas-Desktop alongside developing it for the
browser. The availability of python runtime stack traces and the
simple fact that the standard python interpreter is much better at
catching certain kinds of errors than (brain-damaged) browsers has
generally found to make life much much easier.</p>
